UCI Data Bootcamp Module 3

This code is intended to first write the profit and losses from budget_data.csv, and secondly to determine the election results from election_data.csv

"Resource" and "Analysis" folders were added to both PyBank and PyPoll folders, as well as main.py through the local gitbash terminal.
Code did not write properly to either output file. I feel like I'm really close to getting it right but I'm clearly missing something.
